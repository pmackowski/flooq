== Overview

=== RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is the most popular open source message broker. It supports several messaging protocols with
AMQP protocol being at the forefront.

=== Flooq library
Flooq provides an alternative reactive API for communicating with RabbitMQ using AMQP.
It is not intended to replace any of the existing libraries (even encourages to be used with Reactor RabbitMQ).

Flooq is build on top of Reactor RabbitMQ and Reactor 3 libraries.
It is especially worth considering when any of these libraries are already used.
Following diagram shows its relation to other libraries:

                                   Spring AMQP
                                 /
                                /

                                 \

=== Flooq instance

Everything revolves around `Flooq` instance, which is a first-class citizen in library.

`Flooq` enables building complex scenarios in a functional way. Under the hood,
it forms a graph through which messages flow and are consumed underway. `Flooq` is an owner
of all AMQP entities (exchanges, queues, bindings) that are part of its definition.
It also manages the lifecycle of consumers and producers, creating and destroying them if needed.

`Flooq` is a single unit of work, which e.g. can started or stopped. It is a lazy structure,
nothing happens until it is started.

With its high level API one should consider it as an opinionated library.
Indeed, developer is enforced to use it only in a way that was anticipated by library authors.
In case of unplanned scenario, usage of Reactor RabbitMQ is suggested.

Here, you can see a simple flow with one consumer:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{test-examples}/FlooqApi.java[tag=overview]
----
<1> declare topic exchange *my.exchange*
<2> declare queue *my.queue*
<3> declare binding between *my.queue* and *my.exchange* with routing key `#`
<4> create consumer which uppercases all incoming messages
<5> this is where everything starts
